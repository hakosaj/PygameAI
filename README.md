# Intelligent agents for basic games
HOX! WORK IN PROGRESS, SERIOUSLY


Just a fun run, creating some basic (retro) games and intelligent agents to play them. Will be creating all of the AI-side from scratch.

Pygame is used in creating the game environment. Tensorflow, PyTorch and SKLearn not allowed!

Going to do these games... (tentative):
  - Flappy bird
  - Minesweeper
  - Breakout
  - Snake
  - Tetris

...using these kinds of agents (tentative):
  - Genetic algorithm
  - ANN with backpropagation
  - Q-learning
  - NEAT
  - CNN with only using the screen as input

## Getting Started

DONT USE THIS YET


## Using the software

DONT USE THIS YET

## Next steps
  - Implement the basic structure of a Q-learning agent for FlappyBird
  - Design and implement a base version of Breakout
