# Intelligent agents for basic games
HOX! WORK IN PROGRESS, SERIOUSLY


Just a fun run, creating some basic (retro) games and intelligent agents to play them. Will be creating all of the AI-side from scratch.

Pygame is used in creating the game environment. Tensorflow, PyTorch and SKLearn not allowed!

Going to do these games... (tentative):
  - Flappy bird
  - Minesweeper
  - Breakout
  - Snake
  - Tetris

...using these kinds of agents (tentative):
  - Genetic algorithm
  - ANN with backpropagation
  - Q-learning
  - NEAT
  - CNN with only using the screen as input

![Overview of the simulation](https://github.com/hakosaj/PygameAI/blob/master/flappy/gena.JPG) Flappy bird and genetic algorithms
## Getting Started

Clone this and install requirements from requirements.txt.

Then navigate to folder and voil√°!



## Using the software

### Flappy

For Flappy bird, the command is

`python main.py [algorithm] [loadfile]`

The algorithm options are
  - empty for normal flappy bird
  - "GA" for genetic algorithm
  - "Q" for Q-learning

To load a Q-learning Q-matrix training snapshot, use the "loadfile"-argument to specify the snapshot.



## Status and next steps

### Flappy
  - Separate algos into different files explicitly
  - Implement the NN-based agent: figure out the loss function and backprop
  - Update Q-learning reward scheme etc. so that it actually converges
 
### Breakout
  - Fix the issues with ball+block collisions
  - Implement the first version of AI agent. Maybe Q learning?

### Snake
  - Implement baseline game
  - Not sure how to approach the learning in a state space like this. 
  
### Tetris
  - Implement baseline game
  - No direct interfacing, get all data from the screen as a player would
