# Intelligent agents for basic games

Just a fun run, creating some basic (retro) games and intelligent agents to play them. Will be creating all of the AI-side from scratch.

Pygame is used in creating the game environment. Tensorflow, PyTorch and SKLearn not allowed!

Going to do these games... (tentative):
  - Flappy bird
  - Minesweeper
  - Breakout
  - Snake

...using these kinds of agents (tentative):
  - Genetic algorithm
  - ANN with backpropagation
  - Q-learning
  - NEAT
